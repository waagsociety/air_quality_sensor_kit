## Drawings to cut
![cutprints](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31654421/40780828-10d1cb1a-64da-11e8-836a-e9a3d0e6b468.png)

These are the drawings used to make the casing. The drawing on the left creates a thin wall, in the prototype I stacked 7 of these wall parts of 3 mm MDF. 
The drawing on the right is the front and the backpanel. In the prototype, the front panel is made of 3 mm acrylic and the back panel 3mm MDF.

### Settings laser cutter
The settings of the laser cutter were:
MDF 3 mm : 
Speed : 50, Power : 80, Corner Power : 25
Acrylic 3 mm :
Speed : 50 Power : 80 Corner Power : 25

## Sizes
The width of the bird, measured from its tail to the tip of its beak, is 265 mm. 
My advise is to make the casing slighly bigger so the electronics will fit better.

## Assemble

The parts are stacked as shown; the acrylic front plane at the bottom, followed by 7 wall parts. These parts are but together by 5 long bolts with a nut on top.
The bolt at the position of the eye of the bird has a spacer of 15 mm around it to support the back panel.

## Backpanel

I drilled some holes in the back panel to be able to attach the components. The hole I drilled for the DC motor was too big but it needed to have a firm grip to make the housing rotate. To make this firm grip, I used a small piece of rubber found in the fablab.
